String Anagrams (hard)

Problem Statement
  given a string and a pattern, find all anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

  every anagram is a permutation of a string. as we know, when we are not allowed to repeat chars while finding permutations of a string, we get N! perms/anagrams of a strin ghaving N chars.

  write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string.

Example 1:
Input: String="ppqp", Pattern="pq"
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: The two anagrams of the pattern in the given string are "pq" and "qp".

Written Solution
problem follows the Sliding Window pattern and is similar to the Permutation in a String problem.
We need to find every occurance of any permutation of the pattern in the string. use a list to store the starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the string.

Introduction

often when dealing with arrays, we are asked to deal with subarrays

for example, finding the average of all 5-element sub arrays in a given array

can solve this with brute force or sliding window

brute force:
    Python example:
    
    def find_averages_of_subarrays(K, arr):
        result = []
        for i in range(len(arr)-K+1):
        # find sum of next 'K' elements
            _sum = 0.0
        for j in range(i, i+K):
            _sum += arr[j]
        result.append(_sum/K)  # calculate average

    return result


def main():
  result = find_averages_of_subarrays(5, [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2])
  print("Averages of subarrays of size K: " + str(result))


main()

    time complexity

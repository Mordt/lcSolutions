Longest Substring with Same Letters after Replacement (hard)

problem
Given a string of lowercase letters, if you are allowed to replace no more than 'k' letters with any letter,
find the length of the longest substring having the same letters after replacement.

example
    Input: String="aabccbb", k=2
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Replace the two 'c' with 'b' to have a longest repeating substring "bbbbb".

solution
    sliding window pattern, can use dynamic sliding window like in longest substr with distinct chars.
    can use hashmap to count the frequency of each letter.

    1. will iterate through the string to add one letter at a time to the window.
    2. will keep track of the count of maximum repeating letter in ANY window. clal it maxRepeatLetterCount.
    3. at any time, we know that we have a window with one letter repeating maxRepeatLetterCount times;
        meaning we should try to replace the remaining letters.
        - If remainin gletters are less than or equal to 'k', we can replace them all.
        - if we have mroe than 'k' remaining letters, shrink the window as we cannot replace more than 'k' letters.
    
    we do not need to know the exact max count of the current window, only whether it exceeds the historical max
    count, and that only happens because of a newly added char.

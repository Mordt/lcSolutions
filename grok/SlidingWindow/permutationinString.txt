Problem Challenge 1: Permutation in a String (hard)

Problem statement

given a string and a pattern, find out if the string contains any permutation of the pattern.

permutation is defined as the rearranging of the characters of the string. for example, abc has abc, acb, bac, bca cab and so on.

if a string has 'n' distinct characters, it will have n! permutations.

Example:
Input: String="oidbcaf", Pattern="abc"
Output: true

Problem challenge 4: words concatenation (hard)

Problem statement
given a string and a list of words, find all of the starting indices of substrings in the given string
that are a concatenation of the given words exactly once without overlap. all words same length.

Example
Input: String="catfoxcat", Words=["cat", "fox"]
Output: [0, 3]
Explanation: The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".

Example 2
Input: String="catcatfoxfox", Words=["cat", "fox"]
Output: [3]
Explanation: The only substring containing both the words is "catfox".

Solution
Follows sliding window pattern and has similarities to the Maximum sum subarray of size k problem.
keep track of all words in a HashMap and will tru to match them in the given string. the steps are:
    1. keep freq of each word in HashMap
    2. starting from each index in the string, try to match all the words.
    3. in each iteration, keep track of all words we have already seen in another HashMap
    4. if a word is not found or has a higher frequency than required, we can move onto the next char in the string.
    5. store the index if we have found all words.

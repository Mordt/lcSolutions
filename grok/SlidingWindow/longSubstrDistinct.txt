    sliding window pattern, can use similar dynamic sliding win strategy as discussed in 
    Longest substring with k chars.
    Use a hashmap to remember the last index of each char we have processed, whenever we get to dup,
    shrink sliding window to ensure we always have distinct chars in the window.

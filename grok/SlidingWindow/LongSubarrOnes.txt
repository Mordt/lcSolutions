Longest Subarray with Ones after Replacement (hard)

problem:
    given an array containing 0s and 1s, if you're allowed to replace no more than 'k' 0s with 1s,
    find the length of the longest contiguous subarray having all 1s.

Example
    Input: Array=[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1], k=2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Replace the '0' at index 5 and 8 to have the longest contiguous subarray of 1s having length 6.

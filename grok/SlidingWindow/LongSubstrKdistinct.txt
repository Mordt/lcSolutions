Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters (medium)

Problem
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than k distinct Characters
you can assume that k is less than or equal to the length of the given string.

Solution
sliding window, as before, can use a dynamic sliding window as in the smallest subarray
with a greater sum problem. Can use a HashMap to remember the frequency of each character we have processed.
problem solved thusly:
    1. first insert characters from the beginning of the string until we have k distinct chars in HashMap
    2. these chars will constitute our sliding window. we are asked to find the longest window with no more than
        k distinct chars. remember the length of this window as the longest so far.
    3. keep adding one character to the window in a stepwise fashion.
    4. in each step, try to shrink the window from the beginning if the num of distinct chars in map is greater than k.
        shrink the window till we have no more than k chars in map. necessary to find longest window.
    5. while shrinking, decrement the chars frequency when departing the window and remove it from map if its frequency equals zero.
    6. at the end of each step, we'll check if the current window length is the longest so far, and if so record its length.

Problem Challenge 3: Smallest Window containing Substring (hard)

Problem statement
given a string and a pattern, find the smallest substring in the given string which has all the character occurences of the given pattern.

Example

Input: String="aabdec", Pattern="abc"
Output: "abdec"
Explanation: The smallest substring having all characters of the pattern is "abdec"

Written Solution
sliding window pattern, similar to permutation in a string. we need to find a substring having all chars in pattern.
so required substring can have additional letters.

  1. keep a running count of each matching instance of a char
  2. when matched all chars, try to shrink window from beginning
    keeping track of the smallest substring that has all matching chars.
  3. stop shrinkage when we remove a matched char from window.
  fine to decrement duplicate matching letters.

Introduction
in problems where we deal with sorted lists and need to find a set of elements that fulfil certain constraints,
two pointers approach becomes quite useful. set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray.

example:
given an array of sorted nums and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.

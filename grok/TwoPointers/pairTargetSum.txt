Pair with Target Sum (easy)

old approach:
copy design gurus solution and code, summarise

new approach:
copy problem and examples, ATTEMPT solution, then compare with actual solution.

Problem statement
given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.
write a function to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the given target.

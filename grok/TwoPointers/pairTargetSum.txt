Pair with Target Sum (easy)

old approach:
copy design gurus solution and code, summarise

new approach:
copy problem and examples, ATTEMPT solution, then compare with actual solution.

Problem statement
given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the given target.
write a function to return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the given target.

example 1
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target=6
Output: [1, 3]
Explanation: The numbers at index 1 and 3 add up to 6: 2+4=6

example 2
Input: [2, 5, 9, 11], target=11
Output: [0, 2]
Explanation: The numbers at index 0 and 2 add up to 11: 2+9=11

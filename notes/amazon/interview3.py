# interview notes for final round/onsite interviews with amazon
# 

onsite interview preparation
  up to 5 1hr interviews.
  will be asked 1 technical questoin in each interview slot (leetcode style question)
  will also be asked 2 or 3 behavioural questions based on Leadership Principles.

Technical Questions
  technical questions will cover 3 main areas:
    1. CS fundamentals, Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Design
    2. Coding
    3. System Design
  can be asked verbal questions, such as "given n sorted arrays, return a single sorted array"
  MAKE SURE to ask clarifying questions and state your assumptions. have a clear picture of the 
  problem before you start solving it.
  this will apply to daily work as you always want to completely understand a problem before you begin solving it.

  once you understand the problem, keep an eye on the time and start iteratively solving the problem.
  this means starting small and in an innefficient way, perhaps, but make it more efficient as you go along.
  Break it down into smaller problems. Look at specific use cases and edge cases. 

  Start with a simplified version of the problem then work your way up to the full scope!!

  prepare commonly used algos such as sorting, binary searching and data structures such as HashMaps, Tries, and Linked Lists.

Coding
  need to pay heed to clean, well-structured code that meets amazons standards.
  this obviously means easy to read code with intuitive variable and function names,
  as well as abstracted methods/functions and classes.
  Code also needs to be extensible and maintainable, which is covered by the afotementioned
  abstraction into functions
  
  Object Oriented practices are also another way of writing quality software. You need to have working knowledge
  of common and useful design patterns as well as knowledge of how to write software in an object oriented way.
  Know about inheritance, aggregation, interfaces and composition. Expect to justify your decisions and discuss tradeoffs.

Before You Start
  Understand the coding challenge. ask clarifying questions. be vocal in your thought process as you code.
  Make sure to cover edge cases as this is a common mistake. Be prepared to talk through each one and
  ensure your code can handle it.

  Discuss any shortcomings your solution may have. Discuss any solutions you may have implemented but didin't.'
  Will be writing code that is as close to production ready as possible. PRACTICE.

System Design
  Ownership of open-ended, ambiguous problems are assigned to SDEs. Our job is to come up with the best solution.
  To assess communication skills, I will be asked an opened ended question and I will be judged on how well I can
  bounce ideas off the interviewer, guide the question, and sketch/trawl through the solution.

  Remember:
    handle constraints
    know the inputs you might be receiving.
  Need to be able to know the scope of the problem at hand.

  Consider:
    concurrency
    networking
    abstraction
    real world performance
    latency
    scalability
    estimation
    reliability
    caching
    cache invalidation
  this section is challenging, but its important to be creative and have fun. 

System Design Topics To Review
  Distributed Computing
    understand service-oriented architecture, map reduce, distributed caching, laod balancing and other basic
    distributed computing concepts.
  Scaling
    scaling is important, so research caching, load balancing, nonrelational databases, microservices and sharding

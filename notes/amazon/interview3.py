# interview notes for final round/onsite interviews with amazon
# 

onsite interview preparation
  up to 5 1hr interviews.
  will be asked 1 technical questoin in each interview slot (leetcode style question)
  will also be asked 2 or 3 behavioural questions based on Leadership Principles.

Technical Questions
  technical questions will cover 3 main areas:
    1. CS fundamentals, Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Design
    2. Coding
    3. System Design
  can be asked verbal questions, such as "given n sorted arrays, return a single sorted array"
  MAKE SURE to ask clarifying questions and state your assumptions. have a clear picture of the 
  problem before you start solving it.
  this will apply to daily work as you always want to completely understand a problem before you begin solving it.

  once you understand the problem, keep an eye on the time and start iteratively solving the problem.
  this means starting small and in an innefficient way, perhaps, but make it more efficient as you go along.
  Break it down into smaller problems. Look at specific use cases and edge cases. 

  Start with a simplified version of the problem then work your way up to the full scope!!

  prepare commonly used algos such as sorting, binary searching and data structures such as HashMaps, Tries, and Linked Lists.

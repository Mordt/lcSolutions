Interview Prep SDE
    will meet 4 or 5 devs, each convo will be 60 mins long
    review amazon leadership principles!!
        learn and be curious!!
        Own your projects!
        ask the right questions!!

    Each interviewer will ask about technical skills:
        system design competency
            working knowledge of a few comon and useful design patterns,
            as well as knowledge of how to write software in object-oriented way
            Expect to apply concepts to a particlular problem and defend 
            your design choices.

        three coding competencies
            show off knowledge of fundamentals (hash maps, arrays, binary trees,
            algorithms.)
            evaluation will cover data structures and algorithms, logical and maintainable
            and problem solving.

            consider all 3 as an integrated approach.

tips for preparation
setting stage
    set room up well, check connection, power, etc.
    take notes!!
    remember resume
    consider questions you would like to ask 
        (intiatives/projects, team culture, scope of role)
    reach out if have questions

responding to questions
    start with the customer. include customer (internal or external),
        in situation. work backwards from the customer.
    use multiple examples. do not repeat stories or examples
    when sharing examples, be specific and provide details and data.
    I before we. focus on what YOU owned, what YOU did.
    show how you deal with ambiguity. break questions down, navigate
        intentionally vague requirements. change strategies quickly if approach doesnt work,
        work through open ended questions.
    leverage notes, use them but don't be 100% reliant on them.

Interview apps
    amazon chime: have it ready. download to desktop.
    get used to virtual whiteboarding.

Get to know the interviewers
hiring manager
    typically a software development manager who would directly manage you or similar.
    their role will be to make the best hiring decision for amazon.
    will consider how your skills and experience compare to the objective standards for SDE success at amazon.

    tip:
      the hiring manager can answer questions about the type of work youd do in the role, the future vision of the team and noteworthy accomplishments by the team.
      great person to ask about what it takes to be successful at aazon.

Bar raisers
  objective third parties who act as advisors

what to expect
    taking notes, they will pause to do it
    they will redirect and interrupt to keep you on topic
    will ask probing and follow-up questions
    will answer questions about working at amazon

system design
    be able to explain how your solution solves a problem

    good design is critical to good code.
    use oop best practices. think and talk about software components, distributed systems and system trade-offs
    even more important at amazon because of scale.

    what does system design competency assess?
      measures your ability to black box design a software system (?)
      goal is for you to deliver a design in production with considerations of deployment, scaling failures, availability, and performance. be prepared to discuss latency and concurrency.

    topics to review:
      software systems need software components, something to store data, something to make decisions (business logic) and APIs or processes.
      knowledge of distributed systems, SOA, and n-tiered software architecture is very important in answering system design questions.

      practice drawing the system.

how to best showcase system design
    your interviewer is there to help with questions and that.
    as a designer, you should start with the primary customer and work backwards:
      who are you designing the system for and why
      what expectations do they have in terms of functionality
      what things would a customer assume will be in the system but they may not think about it in the front of their minds? (i.e. it will be fast and secure)
      what happends if we become hyper popular with customers? what will 2x growth look like? or 10x? how would that influence the design?

    understand first what problem your system is supposed to solve. ask clarifying questions if this is ot clear

    see the interviewer as the customer, requirements might be intentionally vague, and they can give you clarifications.

    write/raise the requirements or assumptions you are making, and base your design on them. draw a diagram

other important system design considerations
    scaling is a critical component of software design 
      research scaling when designing your system, research scalablity concepts and tchnology prior to your interview such as caching, load balancing, non-relational databases, micro services and sharding.

    fault tolerance translates to the customer obsession leadership principle
      amazon ensures that even when dependencies are failing theyre doing their best to continue to serve customers. frugal redundancy is important.


Transcript
    suggests logging of cpu and memory util for processes for tracking
    interviewer asks for some clarity regarding issues/failure response

strength is good because:
    see strength criteria such as designs for operational performance, plans for failure and measures results.
    considers both technical and business metrics, as well as data quality
    thinks about how to monitor for performance and catch potential problems
    considers resiliency and making things easier for operators

logical and maintainable
    interview explores how you structure your methods and classes to ensure the logical separation of concerns is clear. 
    explores how you name varuables, methods and classes in a way that is readable and logical.

    test names should describe business and technical requirements, and the test code should be consistent with the test names.

# notes taken on Sets, one of Pythons 4 default data structures.
# the others are Lists, Tuples and Dictionaries (hashmaps)

sets are collections which are unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.

  set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new ones.

set creation:

set = {"one", "two", "three"}

sets do not allow for duplicate items.
sets cannot be referred to by index or key

duplicate values will be ignored. set = {"apple", "apple", "pear", "tomato"} when accessed
will just be apple, pear, tomato

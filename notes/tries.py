notes on the Trie data structure

Intro
  tries are an efficient data retrieval data structure.
  search complexities can be brought down to optimal time (key length) with tries.
  
  a well balanced BST will allow you to search for values in O(M*logn) time, where M is the length of the key.
  in contrast, a trie can search for the key in O(M) time. The tradeoff comes in terms of space.

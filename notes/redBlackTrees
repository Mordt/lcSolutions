Red black trees

BST with one extra attribute for each node: colour, red or black. also need to keep track of the parent of each node.
so the red black structue would be:

struct t_red_black_node {
    enum { red, black } colour;
    void *item;
    struct t_red_black_node *left,
                     *right,
                     *parent;
    }

Red black trees

BST with one extra attribute for each node: colour, red or black. also need to keep track of the parent of each node.
so the red black structue would be:

struct t_red_black_node {
    enum { red, black } colour;
    void *item;
    struct t_red_black_node *left,
                     *right,
                     *parent;
    }

rn null nodes which terminate the tree are leaves and coloured black.

Definition of a red black tree

A red black tree is a BST with the following red-black properties:
    1. every node is either red or black.
    2. every leaf (null) is black
    3. if a node is red, then both its children are black.
    4. every simple path from a node to a descendant leaf contains the same number of black nodes.

hash table notes

made for fast data retrieval at the cost of space

like an array, but indices are related to the data.
    so knowing the data we want helps us find the index in O(1) time.

hash tables use a one way hash function for this. can be used as a hashmap for fast retrieval.

hash function 
    calculation applied to a key to transform it to an index numbers corresponding to a position in the hash table.
    for numeric keys, divide the key by the number of available addresses, n, and take the remainder.
        address = key mod N
    for alphanumeric keys, divide the sum of ascii codes by the number of available addresses, n, and take the remainder.

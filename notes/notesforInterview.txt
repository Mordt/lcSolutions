Leadership principles

    Customer Obsession
        Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. 
        They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
    My example:
        worked extra hard to reduce a page load time by 3 seconds for a customer using accordion salesforce sections instead of individual related lists.

    Ownership
        Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
        They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."
    my example:
        took ownership of several provider workflows in old application, ensuring that the process of creating a new provider to the endscreen was smooth and seamless.

    Learn and Be curious
    my example:
        learned sfdx to transition team to the use of sandboxes and staging environments for a more efficient workflow.

technical topics
    keep customer at the forefront of your mind when designing these solutions.
    check edge cases with code, know tradeoffs and limitations of different data structures and algorithms
    expect to defend design choices

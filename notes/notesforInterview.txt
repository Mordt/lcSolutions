Leadership principles

Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. 
They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

My example:
    worked extra hard to reduce a page load time by 3 seconds for a customer using accordion salesforce sections instead of individual related lists.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. 
They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."
